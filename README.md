# ullweb Action Policy for Code development
## _Code use and deployment action policy at ullweb_

<br />

## Code Development and Design Methodology
- A specific code development pattern with detailed commenting, proper code linting as well as comprehensive documentation will be adopted for all codes being generated at ullweb. 

- Appropriate tagging and metadata must be provided to help identify and track the code builds.

- All codes will include logging. Use clear and descriptive logging messages. Logging will help debug applications when there are issues in production environment 

- Inclusion of basic tests for all codes written as well as adherence to naming conventions. Test driven development helps to achieve a more robust code 

- All secret credentials are to be passed through environmental variables either on local dev environment or through cloud based key management like aws vault, azure key vault or hashicorp vault.



## Code Consistency Guidelines 
- Meaningful variable names are to be adopted. The variable names should be identical to the project and the value it intends to hold 
- Meaningful function names are to be used. The names given to functions should be identical to the use case of the function
- Adoption of a clear naming convention. Either snake cases or camel cases could be used. Only one should be used for the entirety of the project. If camel case is adopted for the project then it should be used all through, same for snake case. Both should not be combined in the same project 
- The use of comments is mandatory for effective documentation. All functions must be commented on as well as logic implementations. Use comments to make code readable and understandable 
- Ensure proper indentation and consistent formatting. The use of an ideal IDE can greatly assist with this.
- Doctrings could be used to explain and highlight certain concepts. It helps make the code verbose
- Memory optimization is ideal. Try to implement code in the best possible way to help optimize memory usage. Short, simple and direct functions and logic are advised 


## Security Best Practices Accompanying Project Development 
1. MFA login is enforced for all who access the companyâ€™s github repo either via web or cli
2. Commits cannot be pushed unless they are signed by GPG keys 
3. Vigilant mode is turned on to enable monitor signed commits. Unsigned commits are squashed 
4. Commits will not be made via Https, only SSH will be allowed 
5. The use of personal access tokens or github apps will be used to login on CLI. no use of git config global which uses Https 
6. Branch protection rules such as branch locks will be used to provide fine grained access to branches and manage merge requests
7. All repositories used in ullweb will be private and non accessible publicly
8. Git guardian to ensure individual credentials and environment variables are not pushed to github


## Key Notations to be strictly adhered to;
- Each project must have a well documented README.md explaining its use case and how its being developed in detail
- Strict adherence to dedicated coding style, with detailed comments and code linting  
- Use of clear naming conventions 
- Clear and descriptive commit messages 
- Devs submit pull request and track bugs and changes using issues in github   
- Strict adherence to Security best practices
- Clear and Concise repository naming convention 
- Project description file must be included in the project directory
- Build releases must be versioned and include extensive metadata 
- All codes must have basic test cases and logging
